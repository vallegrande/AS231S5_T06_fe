# **App Name**: PixelDB Explorer

## Core Features:

- Tabbed Navigation: Tabbed interface for navigating query, create, update, and delete operations.
- Data Grid Display: Display data from the query API in a pixel art-styled grid.
- Pixel Art Forms: Form elements styled with pixel art for creating and updating records.
- AI Translation Tool: Use AI to suggest optimal translations of object descriptions in the create and update data entry forms.
- Soft Delete: Implement 'soft delete' functionality by toggling a flag (rather than fully removing objects from the database).
- Status Notifications: Implement notification feedback when object queries return no results, or mutations complete.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A retro-game magenta (#FF00FF) to capture the pixel art feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to provide contrast and enhance the vibrancy of the pixel art elements.
- Accent color: Bright cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif for a techy look that suits both headlines and smaller text.
- Design pixelated icons for navigation and actions, using 16x16 or 32x32 pixel grids for a retro aesthetic.
- Use a grid-based layout with spacing to mimic the pixelated style, ensuring elements align to the pixel grid.
- Incorporate simple, blocky animations (e.g., fading, sliding) to enhance the retro pixel art feel during interactions.
